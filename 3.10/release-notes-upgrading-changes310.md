### arangobench

The following deprecated arangobench testcases have been removed from _arangobench_:

* `counttrx`
* `deadlocktrx`
* `multi-collection`
* `multitrx`
* `random-shapes`
* `shapes`

These test cases had been deprecated since ArangoDB 3.9.

The testcase `hash` was renamed to `persistent-index` to better reflect its
scope.
